### Hi there 👋

<!--
**lmcelhattan/lmcelhattan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Ph.D. at the University of Florida.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code and research my topics of interest.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on as much as possible so that I can learn from those before me.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with new material that I have never seen before
- 💬 Ask me about my hobbies!
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love animals and art!
