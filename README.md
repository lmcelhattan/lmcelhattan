**lmcelhattan/lmcelhattan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Ph.D. at the University of Florida.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code and research my topics of interest.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on as much as possible so that I can learn from those before me.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with new material that I have never seen before
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my hobbies!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love animals and art!
